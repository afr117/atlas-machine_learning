# Slice Me Up - Python Slicing Task

## Project Overview
This project is part of the **linear_algebra** directory within the **atlas-machine_learning** repository. The goal of the task is to practice Python slicing operations on arrays, specifically to extract subsets of data without using loops or conditionals.

## Task Details
In this task, the array slicing operations are implemented to:
- Extract the first two numbers of the array.
- Extract the last five numbers of the array.
- Extract the 2nd through 6th numbers of the array.

The solution follows all guidelines provided, including:
- No loops or conditionals are used.
- The script is exactly 8 lines long.
- The task adheres to `pycodestyle` formatting standards.

## File Structure
- **0-slice_me_up.py**: The main Python script containing the slicing operations.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project and task.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9
- Numpy (version 1.25.2)
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Files should be executable
- Follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.11.1) guidelines

## How to Run the Script
1. Navigate to the `math/linear_algebra` directory.
2. Make sure the file is executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x 0-slice_me_up.py
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
./0-slice_me_up.py
